# Terraform testings
This repository is intended to investigate and test Terraform.
The main purpose of this repo is a quick deployment of KVM VMs for installing and configuring OpenShift v3

## LIBVIRT
Libvirt is not supported in Terraform at the moment, but I forked [terraform-provider-libvirt](http://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt.git)



### Changelog
* v0.2  - Added variables and variable files to customize deployment.
* v0.1  - Initial work. Almost everything is hardcoded.
